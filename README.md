# sorting_algorithms
________

This project implements various sorting algorithms in C. It provides the ability to sort arrays of integers in either ascending or descending order.

<h2>Features:</h2>

. Supports sorting of integers
Offers both ascending and descending order options
Implements Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort
Installation:

No specific installation is required. The code is ready to use.

<h2>Usage:</h2>

Include sorting.h header file.
Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
Run the compiled program and provide input data and sorting parameters.
<h2>Example Usage:</h2>

C
`#include <stdio.h>
#include "sorting.h"

int main() {
    int arr[] = {5, 2, 8, 1, 3};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    sort(arr, n, ASCENDING); // Replace sort function with appropriate call

    std::cout << "Sorted array: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}`
Use code with caution.


<h2>Testing:</h2>

Unit tests have been implemented to verify the correctness of each sorting algorithm.

<h2>Contributing:</h2>

Contributions are welcome! Please follow standard coding conventions and submit pull requests for any changes.

<h2>Additional Notes:</h2>

This project only demonstrates basic functionalities. Consider adding features like:

Support for different data types (e.g., floats, strings)
More sorting algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Counting Sort, etc.)
Performance optimizations and benchmarks
Feel free to reach out for any questions or suggestions.
